## Item Questions

QUESTIONS ABOUT ITEMS
- I think: key items are uncountable.  everything else is countable.  an item can be held iff it is countable.
- how long do
- check bp for ultimate held item ref or something
- I need a better way to represent NPC interactions in different games
- how much does growth mulch accelerate soil drying?  how much does damp mulch slow it?
- does lum berry cure confusion?
- how does sweet heart work?  it seems a guy in mistralton will trade some for heart scales?
- kind of guessing about the * urge items
