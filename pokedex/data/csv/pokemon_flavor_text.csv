If you peer down into the dark sea from
a ship at night, you can sometimes seethis POKéMON’s light rising from the
depths where it swims. It gives the sea
an appearance of a starlit night."
171,9,"The light-emitting orbs on its back are
very bright. They are formed from a part of
its dorsal fin. This POKéMON illuminates
the inky darkness of deep seas."

short out electricity with another
PICHU, creating a shower of sparks.In that event, this POKéMON will begin
